# 概述

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements.

Here are a few sample use-cases that Elasticsearch could be used for:

- Cluster
- Node
- Index是一个数据库
- Type是一个表
- Document是一条记录
- Filed是一个字段
- Term是一个分词
- Segment是？？可能是相当于一个表吧
